To have an ending means that there lies a beginning.
To have a beginning means that something was ended to start a new.
Things change, people change, stories grow, thus chapters continue.
To feel meloncholy, the bittersweet of it all.
To feel anxiety, stress yet excitement for what will come.
Change comes with uncertainties,
Both blessings yet also rebirth.
End of an era, start anew.
